1. Storing "setting.timebuffer" into uint cache in the function createBid() can save a decent amount of gas.

In the following function, setting.timebuffer should be cached as it is read several times.

Create a cache: uint256 cache = setting.timebuffer and replace them.
src/auction/Auction.sol
(Before) 141: extend = (_auction.endTime - block.timestamp) < settings.timeBuffer;
(After) 141: extend = (_auction.endTime - block.timestamp) < cache;

(Before) 149: auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + settings.timeBuffer);
(After) 149: auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + cache);

2. Storing "auction.settled" into bool cache in the function _settleAuction() can save a decent amount of gas.

In the following function, auction.settled should be cached as it is read several times

Create a cache: bool settled = auction.settled and replace them.
src/auction/Auction.sol
(Before) 172: if (auction.settled) revert AUCTION_SETTLED();
(After) 172: if (settled) revert AUCTION_SETTLED();

(Before) 181: auction.settled = true;
(After) 181: settled = true;

3. Two functions in the Auction contract use a memory location to retrieve auction

Using storage pointer instead of memory location can save a decent amount of gas.

a) The first function is createBid(), make sure to declare the memory location to a storage one

src/auction/Auction.sol
(Before) 92: Auction memory _auction = auction;
(After) 92:  Auction storage _auction = auction;

And replacing the storage cache with these three saves extra gas.
(Before) 130: auction.highestBid = msg.value;
(After) 130: _auction.highestBid = msg.value;

(Before) 133: auction.highestBidder = msg.sender;
(After) 133: _auction.highestBidder = msg.sender;

(Before) 149: auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + settings.timeBuffer);
(After) 149: _auction.endTime = uint40(block.timestamp + settings.timeBuffer);

b) The second function is _settleAuction(), make sure to declared the memory location to a storage one

src/auction/Auction.sol
(Before) 169: Auction memory _auction = auction;
(After) 169: Auction storage _auction = auction;

And replacing the storage cache with these two saves extra gas.
(Before) 172: if (auction.settled) revert AUCTION_SETTLED();
(After) 172: if (_auction.settled) revert AUCTION_SETTLED();

(Before) 181: auction.settled = true;
(After) 181: _auction.settled = true;

There is no need for boolean comprasions, so l am going to delete the "true".
(Before) 181: _auction.settled = true;
(After) 181: !_auction.settled;

// Note that the b) method can't be used at the same time with the "2. Storing "auction.settled" into bool cache ", this here saves a lot more gas than the bool cache. 

4. l am going to do few changes in these five functions, and l don't want to describe them separately. So l will form them into one report here:

-In the function cancle() - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/governance/governor/Governor.sol#L353

a) l am going to replace the memory location with storage:
(Before) 358: Proposal memory proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
(After) 358: Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];

b) After that l will use the storage proposal on: 
(Before) 368: proposals[_proposalId].canceled = true;
(After) 368: proposal.canceled = true;

d) And finally there is no need for boolean comprasions, so l am going to delete the "true".
(Before) 368: proposal.canceled = true;
(After) 368: !proposal.canceled;

-In the function veto() - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/governance/governor/Governor.sol#L385

a) same as the last function, the boolean comprasions is no needed and therefore we will delete the "true" to save gas.
(Before) 396: proposal.vetoed = true;
(After) 396: !proposal.vetoed;

-In the function state() - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/governance/governor/Governor.sol#L413

a) going to replace the memory location with storage.
(Before) 415: Proposal memory proposal = proposals[_proposalId];
(After) 415: Proposal storage proposal = proposals[_proposalId];

-In the function execute() - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/governance/governor/Governor.sol#L324

a) same as the last function, the boolean comprasions is no needed and therefore we will delete the "true" to save gas.
(Before) 337: proposals[proposalId].executed = true;
(After) 337: !proposals[proposalId].executed;

-In the function _castVote() - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/governance/governor/Governor.sol#L248

a) ">=" cost less gas than ">"
The compiler uses opcodes GT and ISZERO for solidity code that uses >, but only requires LT for >=, which saves gas.
(Before) 261: if (_support > 2) revert INVALID_VOTE();
(After) 261: if (_support >= 3) revert INVALID_VOTE();

b) same as the last function, the boolean comprasions is no needed and therefore we will delete the "true" to save gas.
(Before) 264: hasVoted[_proposalId][_voter] = true;
(After) 264: !hasVoted[_proposalId][_voter];

-In the function propose() - https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/governance/governor/Governor.sol#L116

a) l am going to create two caches for the arrays "_value.length" and "_calldata.length"
(Add) + uint256 numValue = _values.length;
(Add) + uint256 numCalldatas = _calldatas.length;
(Before) 138: if (numTargets != _values.length) revert PROPOSAL_LENGTH_MISMATCH();
(After) 138: if (numTargets != numValue) revert PROPOSAL_LENGTH_MISMATCH();
(Before) 139: if (numTargets != _calldatas.length) revert PROPOSAL_LENGTH_MISMATCH();
(After) 139: if (numTargets != numCalldatas) revert PROPOSAL_LENGTH_MISMATCH();
