1. The usage of `msg.value` here is unclear and also does not have any checks. As far as I know, the `Treasury.execute` uses Treasury fund, so make `Governor.execute` `payable` is no need

2. The logic here https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/auction/Auction.sol#L149 does not match with the comment at the line above it. From the comment, I think should be `auction.endTime = uint40(auction.endTime + settings.timeBuffer)`
3. The execution of `MetadataRenderer.addProperties` should be careful enough to not break the invariant `numStoredProperties + numNewProperties < 16`. Because there is no way to remove properties and when `properties.length >= 16`, there is revert at https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-09-nouns-builder/blob/7e9fddbbacdd7d7812e912a369cfd862ee67dc03/src/token/metadata/MetadataRenderer.sol#L194 when `i >= 15`. This could lead to revert on `onMinted` and the `Auction` will be in DOS status.
Consider have a function to remove properties or have a check when adding new properties
