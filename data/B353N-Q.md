 tokenId Is used before declaration: auction.tokenId = tokenId (src/auction/Auction.sol#208)

In the case above, the variable x is used before its declaration, which may result in unintended consequences. Additionally, the for-loop uses the variable max, which is declared in a previous scope that may not always be reached. This could lead to unintended consequences if the user mistakenly uses a variable prior to any intended declaration assignment. It also may indicate that the user intended to reference a different variable.

Using block.timestamp which can be manipulate by miners:
src/governance/treasury/Treasury.sol#74-78
Auction.sol in function createBit
timestamps[_proposalId] != 0 (src/governance/treasury/Treasury.sol#83)
block.timestamp < tokenRecipient[baseTokenId].vestExpiry (src/token/Token.sol#186)
timestamps[_proposalId] != 0 && block.timestamp >= timestamps[_proposalId] (src/governance/treasury/Treasury.sol#89)
