In Solidity 0.8+, there’s a default overflow check on unsigned integers. It’s possible to uncheck this in for-loops and save some gas at each iteration, but at the cost of some code readability, as this uncheck cannot be made inline.

Instances include:

    Treasury.execute():		for (uint256 i = 0; i < numTargets; ++i) // l.162
    Token._addFounders():	for (uint256 i; i < numFounders; ++i) // l.80
    Token._addFounders():      for (uint256 j; j < founderPct; ++j) // l.108

The code would go from:

    for (uint256 i; i < numIterations; ++i) {  
     // ...  
    }  
to

    for (uint256 i; i < numIterations;) {  
     // ...  
     unchecked { ++i; }  
    }
